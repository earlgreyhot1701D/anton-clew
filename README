# Anton Clew

**Deterministic safety guardrails for AI-assisted coding workflows.**

Anton Clew is a policy-driven CLI that evaluates file changes in a Git repository and classifies them as **ALLOW**, **NEEDS_APPROVAL**, or **DENY** based on explicit repository rules. It is designed to protect codebases in environments where AI agents or automation generate changes faster than humans can reliably review them.

Unlike AI code reviewers that rely on probabilistic judgments, Anton Clew enforces **clear, test-backed rules** before changes are committed.

## Why Anton Clew Exists

AI coding tools are powerful—but they are not inherently safe.

As agentic workflows become more common, automation can:
- modify sensitive files unintentionally,
- change critical configuration without context,
- or push large batches of code faster than meaningful human review can happen.

This project was built while experimenting with agent-driven coding workflows and seeing firsthand how easy it is for automation to make fast, confident, and risky changes.

Most safeguards today happen **after** changes are made.  
Anton Clew shifts safety **left**, enforcing guardrails *before* commits land.

---

## The Idea

Anton Clew uses **policy as code** to make repository safety explicit.

Each staged file is evaluated against a YAML policy and assigned one of three outcomes:

- **ALLOW**  
  The file matches no restrictive rules and can proceed freely.

- **NEEDS_APPROVAL**  
  The file matches a pattern that requires explicit human review.

- **DENY**  
  The file matches a forbidden pattern and is blocked entirely.

Decisions are deterministic and reproducible—no AI interpretation, no ambiguity.

## Features

- Deterministic file classification (no hallucinations)
- Simple YAML-based policy configuration
- Supports exact paths, glob patterns, and nested directories
- Prioritizes deny rules over approval rules
- Designed for local use, hooks, and CI
- Fully test-backed with Vitest
- ESM-compatible Node.js CLI

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/antonclew.git
cd anton-clew
npm install

Usage
Development Mode (recommended for first run)
npm run dev -- --help

Initialize a Policy
npm run dev -- init


This generates a starter policy file (typically .agentpolicy.yaml) in the current repository.

Check Staged Files

Stage files as usual:

git add .


Then run:

npm run dev -- check --staged


Example output:

✓ README.md
  └─ ALLOW: No restrictions apply

⚠ src/core/engine.ts
  └─ NEEDS_APPROVAL: Matches approval-required pattern: src/**

✗ secrets/private.key
  └─ DENY: Matches deny pattern: **/*.key


If any files are denied or require approval, the check fails.

Example Policy
deny_paths:
  - "**/*.key"
  - "**/*.pem"

approval_required_paths:
  - "src/**"
  - "package.json"
  - "tsconfig.json"


Files matching deny_paths are blocked.

Files matching approval_required_paths require human approval.

All other files are allowed.

Where It Fits in AI Workflows

Anton Clew is particularly useful when:

AI agents generate or modify code automatically

Commits are produced by scripts or automation

Teams want predictable, enforceable safeguards instead of post-hoc review

It can be used:

Manually before commits

As a pre-commit hook

In CI pipelines validating AI-generated changes

Development Notes

This project was built with assistance from GitHub Copilot CLI, which was used during development to:

Diagnose failing Vitest test suites

Resolve Node.js ESM import resolution issues

Fix TypeScript build errors

Apply minimal, reviewable patches during QA

Copilot CLI acted as a terminal-native development assistant, not a runtime dependency.

Additional reference validation and architectural discussion leveraged ChatGPT during development.

Design Philosophy

Determinism over vibes

Explicit rules over probabilistic guesses

Fail early, fail clearly

Safety without slowing developers down

The name Anton Clew is a quiet nod to the Silicon Valley “Son of Anton” reference—a system that calmly enforces order while other systems move fast and break things.

Testing

Run the test suite:

npm test


Build output:

npm run build


All core logic is covered by unit tests.

Requirements

Node.js 18+

npm

Credits

Anton Clew was built using AI-assisted development tools with human oversight.

GitHub Copilot CLI was used as a terminal-native assistant during debugging, testing, and incremental code fixes.

ChatGPT was used for architectural discussion, problem framing, and documentation drafting.

All design decisions, approvals, and final responsibility are human-made.

AI assisted. Human approved.
All mistakes are my own.

Status

Anton Clew is an MVP built for experimentation, learning, and hackathon submission.
It is stable, tested, and intentionally minimal.
